It‚Äôs more about adaptation to the new ‚Äúisolated‚Äù lifestyle. And all the simple things such as going outside with a friend, 1-day trip somewhere to the upstate, meeting new person‚Ä¶ all these getting more special than it was before. 
One thing I wanted to describe in 2020 is the Chinese New Year. It was the night between Jan 24 and Jan 25. Like a month before Pratt was closed and we started to take classes/work from home. Some people already started wearing masks. Soo it was a party somewhere in Ridgewood organized by one of the students at Pratt. I wasn‚Äôt sure I want to go because I knew nothing about Chinese traditions and had no idea what we all are going to do there. They also asked to wear everything red (‚Äúgood-luck‚Äù tradition) and I had no red clothes at all. This day I got a text message from Martha. She asked if we can go together. She also had nothing red and made for us red bracelets; we decided to go and leave at any point if something goes weird. It turned out to be a super fun party. We cooked dumplings all together. I learned a lot about Chinese cuisine and met a lot of Pratt students I haven‚Äôt met before. It felt unusual to met the same people but in another environment. I also lost my phone and keys and couldn't find them for a couple of hours ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
it was so adequate and nice, I couldn‚Äôt even expect üòÇ this is probably not the most memorable pandemic event, but it‚Äôs what I remember","Chinese, friendly, funny",#CC0000,Red is the official color of Chinese New Year:),positive,fun

Already having a sense that a lockdown seemed inevitable, but having no idea how long it would be, my partner, best friend and I booked last minute front row seats for Celine Dion‚Äôs concert in Newark, even though we had just seen her perform a week prior in Brooklyn. It was a transcendent experience, seeing a personal icon of mine just feet away. Never in my life have I experienced a live performance so vocally breath taking, and yet so effortless. 

The mood of the crowd was distinctly cautious, and I specifically remember a moment when Celine adjusted her heavily made up eyelashes, and a guy sitting a few rows behind us screamed out ‚ÄòCeline, don‚Äôt touch your face!‚Äô Even now, over a year later, this concert symbolizes the last moment of unmasked, non-paranoid normalcy.

She waited outside, feeling who knows what, as I sat there for the last time with our dog. Later that day my family met in the park to be with me.
