It‚Äôs more about adaptation to the new ‚Äúisolated‚Äù lifestyle. And all the simple things such as going outside with a friend, 1-day trip somewhere to the upstate, meeting new person‚Ä¶ all these getting more special than it was before. 
One thing I wanted to describe in 2020 is the Chinese New Year. It was the night between Jan 24 and Jan 25. Like a month before Pratt was closed and we started to take classes/work from home. Some people already started wearing masks. Soo it was a party somewhere in Ridgewood organized by one of the students at Pratt. I wasn‚Äôt sure I want to go because I knew nothing about Chinese traditions and had no idea what we all are going to do there. They also asked to wear everything red (‚Äúgood-luck‚Äù tradition) and I had no red clothes at all. This day I got a text message from Martha. She asked if we can go together. She also had nothing red and made for us red bracelets; we decided to go and leave at any point if something goes weird. It turned out to be a super fun party. We cooked dumplings all together. I learned a lot about Chinese cuisine and met a lot of Pratt students I haven‚Äôt met before. It felt unusual to met the same people but in another environment. I also lost my phone and keys and couldn't find them for a couple of hours ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I couldn‚Äôt hug my mom (who had just lost her mom) and we couldn‚Äôt celebrate the life of my grandmother the way we would have wanted to and the way she would have wanted us to.

But, truly, the one date/event that sticks out to me the most is the last public event I attended, on March 8, 2020. Already having a sense that a lockdown seemed inevitable, but having no idea how long it would be, my partner, best friend and I booked last minute front row seats for Celine Dion‚Äôs concert in Newark, even though we had just seen her perform a week prior in Brooklyn. It was a transcendent experience, seeing a personal icon of mine just feet away. Never in my life have I experienced a live performance so vocally breath taking, and yet so effortless. 

The mood of the crowd was distinctly cautious, and I specifically remember a moment when Celine adjusted her heavily made up eyelashes, and a guy sitting a few rows behind us screamed out ‚ÄòCeline, don‚Äôt touch your face!‚Äô Even now, over a year later, this concert symbolizes the last moment of unmasked, non-paranoid normalcy.  I vividly remember every costume, every belted note with a level of clarity that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been able to capture since. ","Exhilarating, overindulgent, inspiring ",I have no color deficiency.,CC0000,"The concert design largely used this color, so it is mostly a visual correlation. Celine‚Äôs most iconic gown of the evening was this shade of red.","Again, this feels like such a silly answer given the reality of the past year for so many. I have been very fortunate in the past year to experience many milestones - a promotion, leaving my job to start my own company, purchasing my first home, and yet March 8 still stays with me the most vividly.

3/17/21 14:55,F,Yes,25-40,Female,3/16/20,"Charlotte, NC, USA","It was the day I broke down and almost ruined my relationship.  I had some social anxiety before our state's shutdown.  So, staying home was actually a personal reprieve.  I was already really stressed and upset that night and made the mistake of watching Grey Gardens, which is a movie about two recluses.  I thought it would be really great to be a recluse for the rest of my life because I was too scared of the world outside.  I wanted the virus to go away, but I didn't want to be forced to go outside and interact with the world.  My partner, who was dealing with his own stress, didn't understand my feelings or what I was saying.  I don't think I exactly know what I was saying either; I just felt scared and done with the world.  It didn't seem like a fair playing field out there, so why join in?  I knew I would eventually have to get out into the world, but at the time, I was just voicing my anxiety, hoping for some encouraging words as a response.  Instead, my partner said he didn't want to be with someone who didn't want to be in the world anymore, and everything just escalated from there.  ","stressful, upset, hysterical",I have no color deficiency.,FF3300,"There were high tensions, but no rage, which I associate with a bright red.

","While the pandemic has been horrible for my family(my dad has been out of a job until this mid March, we can barely pay mortgage without going into all of our savings, we have had to find our own health care that hasn‚Äôt covered anything but cost a lot), I have luckily not lost anyone in my family to it. My family has bonded over this. We have talked more and been more open. My dad found a new hobby and my mom learned that she doesn‚Äôt need to bear all the financial burden in the family. I have gotten closer with my parents and put their health before mine countless times during this pandemic.

It was my first time experiencing the ability/freedom we citizens have in speaking out in public with large groups. We put our possible health on the line to speak out. I found out that people won't hold back on speaking their beliefs no matter the circumstance, even in a pandemic. This is what freedom is all about - no matter what side you're on or point on the Political Spectrum Chart, having the freedom to speak out in public with whatever you want makes our country truly outstanding.

There is still that brightness but fading, a color that resonates with the feeling of lost, confusion, troubled and frightening. ","At the onset of the lockdown, I thought that our government weren't serious especially when public transportation will no longer be available to the public. One official in an interview answered that people will walk to the markets to buy food because there wouldn't be any public transportation available. It was true then the seriousness of the problem became real. Scholars released initial studies that the effects of this will last 3-4-5 years or so. I could not believe it...

This announcement was the ""nail in the coffin"" as it followed announcements that my community college I work at would be transitioning to virtual operations and my local library I also worked at would be closed indefinitely. It cemented that this situation with Covid was real and threatening. I wasn't even wearing a mask yet when I received these notifications. Suddenly, my whole world was at a standstill and the entire world was shutting down around me. Everything on Twitter about shutdowns, was true. Daily briefings on Covid became my reality after this date. All of my interactions with people, media, and space completely changed (and have yet to really return to anything that could be classified as ""normal"").","Anxious, Unnerved, Fearful",I have no color deficiency.,0066FF,"It reminds me of Twitter blue.

I realized while writing about 3/11/20 that I haven't really processed the experience of the day itself and my actions that occurred after the announcement that the world was closing.

That morning I got up, put on my best ‚Äúeverything is okay face,‚Äù and brought my dog to the park one last time. This was before we all wore masks, but we did distance. On the last day my dog was alive, all of these people we had only met a year before came out to see her, despite how sad of a time we were already living through. No one was able to hug me, despite them really wanting to. At 3:15 I brought my dog to the vet, and had to go in without my partner. She waited outside, feeling who knows what, as I sat there for the last time with our dog. Later that day my family met in the park to be with me. This sounds great except we were sitting in a wide circle adhering to social distancing standards. Grief in the time of COVID, especially early on, was such a lonely experience.
