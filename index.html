    <h1 style="padding-bottom: 20px">In the Time of COVID: A text and sentiment analysis of individual stories in the
        time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic</h1>

    <p style="padding-top: 35px;">If we consider data as the communication of an abstraction or measurement taken from
        the world (Kelleher & Tierney,
        2018), the human race has been collecting data for millennia. Once acquired, this material is then cleaned and
        composed
        to illuminate information which may inactivate change. Therefore, it is no surprise that like humans, data have
        past
        stories that are often only revealed over time. Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the world has
        monitored and
        tracked the global spread and the effects of the virus in data dashboards that display reported cases, death
        tolls, and
        economic costs. Yet, as devastating and life changing a period as this has been, no method of cataloguing the
        general
        sentiment of people exists.</p>

    <p>Analysis of qualitative data is perhaps the most difficult type of data to analyze. Yet, when combined and
        reviewed with
        quantitative information, such as time, the inferences that may be drawn have the potential to illuminate the
        differences and similarities of so many things. The benefits of conducting this study during the COVID-19
        pandemic are
        twofold: (1) providing a confidential outlet for individuals to cathartically recount a meaningful experience
        from this
        time unlike any other they may have experienced, and (2) the opportunity for the world to examine an aspect of
        the
        qualitative experience of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <h1>COVID-19 As We Know It</h1>
    <p style="padding-top: 35px; padding-bottom: 50px;">INSERT STANDARD CHART OF COVID 19 CASES, DEATHS
    </p>

    <p>
        INSERT PARAGRAPH THAT TIES ANALYSIS OF COVID TO SENTIMENT/EMOTION AND MINIMUAL MEMORIALIZATION OF THE LIVES OF
        THOSE
        THAT
        PAST,
        SURVIVED, OR LIVED THROUGH TIMES OF DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY DISEASE.

    <p>Inspired by the Date Paintings of Japanese conceptual artist, On Kawara, and the (Süd-) Koreanischer Kalender /
        (South)
        Korean Calendar (1991) created by German conceptual artist, Hanne Darboven, this project used an online survey
        to
        collect pertinent dates and stories of thirteen individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once collected, the
        data will
        be cleaned and analyzed via text and sentiment analysis. This data will then be part of a data dashboard that
        allows
        users to not only trace the reported cases and death tolls by date, but some personal sentiments and/or
        reflections of
        people as well.</p>
