            <h1>In the Time of COVID: A text and sentiment analysis of individual stories in the
                time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic</h1>
            <div id="intro">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>If we consider data as the communication of an abstraction or measurement taken
                    from the world (Kelleher & Tierney,
                    2018), the human race has been collecting data for millennia. Once acquired, this material is then
                    cleaned and
                    composed
                    to illuminate information which may inactivate change. Therefore, it is no surprise that like
                    humans,
                    data have
                    past
                    stories that are often only revealed over time. Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the
                    world
                    has
                    monitored and
                    tracked the global spread and the effects of the virus in data dashboards that display reported
                    cases,
                    death
                    tolls, and
                    economic costs. Yet, as devastating and life changing a period as this has been, no method of
                    cataloguing the
                    general
                    sentiment of people exists.</p>

                <p>Analysis of qualitative data is perhaps the most difficult type of data to analyze.
                    Yet, when combined and
                    reviewed with
                    quantitative information, such as time, the inferences that may be drawn have the potential to
                    illuminate the
                    differences and similarities of so many things. The benefits of conducting this study during the
                    COVID-19
                    pandemic are
                    twofold: (1) providing a confidential outlet for individuals to cathartically recount a meaningful
                    experience
                    from this
                    time unlike any other they may have experienced, and (2) the opportunity for the world to examine an
                    aspect of
                    the
                    qualitative experience of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                <div id="stdchart">
                    <h2>COVID-19 As We Know It</h2>
                    <p>Charts such as the ones below, have become the standard for how we track cases, deaths, and for
                        some mark time in the COVID-era. While informative, these charts do not provide qualitative
                        information about the lives of the individuals surrounding the data.

                <p>Inspired by the <i>Date Paintings</i> of Japanese conceptual artist, <a

                        Kawara</a>, and the <i>(Süd-)

                        Kalender /
                        (South)
                        Korean Calendar</i> (1991) created by German conceptual artist, <a
                        href="https://www.moma.org/artists/1388">Hanne Darboven</a>, this project used an
                    online
                    survey
                    to
                    collect pertinent dates and stories of fourteen (14) individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic to
                    date
                    (January 2020 - March 2021). Once
                    collected, the
                    data was cleaned, analyzed, and used to develop a data visualization that allows users to not ony
                    trace
                    reported cases and death tolls by date, but some personal sentiments and/or reflection of the people
                    as
                    well.</p>
                <p>If elements of Kawara’s were modified and use to encode personal textual accounts of events
                    throughout COVID-19,
                    this
                    qualitatively enriched information could provide new insight into the significance of the
                    time-series events of
                    the
                    period. The power of personal stories is their emotive ability to captivate. In the time of COVID,
                    many of the
                    events
                    that would allow one to evaluate the significance of a life lost, like a memorial service have been
                    postponed
                    indefinitely. Yet, as journalist Jonathan Freedland notes, “history suggests that even when the
                    mortal danger of
                    COVID
                    passes, we may not indulge in a collective sorrow/remembering because unlike wars, pandemics do not
                    follow
                    linear story:
                    clear heroes and villains with intent and motive” (Freedland, 2021). At a time when not only loss of
                    life has
                    been so
                    great, but also loss of cultural traditions and ways of life, to mark and remember this period with
                    only points
                    in a
                    time-series chart is to diminish the significance of what it is to be human.

                    <p style="padding-bottom:0px">
                        The project aims to address the following questions:
                        <br><em>RQ: </em>If the life of an individual is full of meaningful experiences connected to
                        times and
                        places,
                        how can text and sentiment
                        analysis illustrate these events?
                        <br><em>RQ: </em>Does color describe and/or shape the memory of an experience?<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Using an online survey, the following information was confidentially collected from each
                        participant:
                        <br> - Demographics (age range, gender,location at the time of their COVID memory).
                        <br> - A description of events surrounding a day meaningful to them since the onset of
                        worldwide quarantine procedures invoked by the COVID-19 pandemic and why it is meaningful to
                        them.
                        <br> - Three (3) words that they feel describes this day and COVID-era memory.
                        <br> - A color picker (as shown below) of 81 web standard colors to select one (1) from.

                    <p>The project included the following phases and procedures:
                        <br> - <em>Design.</em> The data collection instrument,the online survey, was designed and
                        pilot tested by three (3) users.
                        <br> - <em>Analysis of
                            COVID-19 case related data</em> Data from the <a
                            href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">COVID-19 Data
                            Repository by the Center
                            for Systems
                            Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University </a>was collected and
                        analyzed.
                        <br> - <em>Participant Recruitment</em> Adults, 18 years of age or older, were recruited
                        through
                        institutional mailing lists and social media platforms (i.e., Twitter, Instagram, Reddit)
                        over the
                        course of two weeks. The Gif below was featured in all digital recruitment media.

                        thoughts,emotions, and description of events

                        invoked by the
                        COVID-19 pandemic was collected.
                        <br> - <em>Data Analysis</em> Once cleaned of any and all identifying information, the data was
                        analyzed
                        with Python. All code, cleaned data, and

                            repository</a>.
                        <br> - <em>Data Visualization</em> A website was created in HTML and CSS to display data
                        visualizations created in Python and D3.js. The site and D3.js visualization <a
                            href="data.html">(shown here)</a> underwent two user tests--one asynchronous and virtual and
