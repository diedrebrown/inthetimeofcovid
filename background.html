    <h1>Project Background</h1>
    <p>We are—all of us—endowed with unique stories that illustrate one’s experiences, passions, hopes, and fears.
        Different as
        our stories may be, their one commonality is that they are tied to a time and a place. Since the onset of the
        COVID-19
        pandemic, through data dashboards displaying the global spread of the disease, the world has become familiar
        with
        time-series data visualizations. Largely grouped into specifics of related chunks of information, these
        visualizations
        illustrate changes over time in a manner conducive to the cognitive load of our short-term memories (Knaflic,
        2015). The
        time-series graph provides a periodicity to the information, and it distills complicated, time-value
        relationships down
        to points connected lines that allow analysts to find trends, correlations, and variations (Munzer, 2014). While
        the
        time-series chart captures the quantitative nature of these moments, the qualitative information that may
        contribute to
        the time-value relationship is not considered. The means of gathering and assessing the qualitative data story
        are left
        to the researcher through inferences, lab studies, and field studies (Holtzblatt and Jones, 1993).</p>
    <p>An ally to one’s comprehension of data visualizations is their long-term memory. Long-term memory is built up
        over a
        lifetime and important for pattern recognition and general cognitive processing (Knaflic, 2015). Though based on
        an
        individual’s experience, recall of images stored in one’s long-term memory assists in rationalizing information
        (Knaflic, 2015). In many respects, art is a form of information visualization that relies on one’s long-term
        memory of
        the historical record. Foucault argued that the maker of a work is “a conduit for the ideas of the period”
        (Foucault,
        1984). And in this sense, the artist’s work becomes a record of time (Molina Franjola, 2020) equip with their
        cognitive
        impression of present events. The work of conceptual artist, On Kawara’s “Date Paintings” (or Today series) fits
        this
        definition of the maker and artwork, as each work in the series is a document of a specific day, country, and
        local
        newspaper clippings of a historical event that Kawara witnessed and felt left an impression on his life.</p>
    <p>As a member of the social-realist art movement in Japan, On Kawara and others worked to expose the reality of the
        catastrophe and defeat, which the Japanese government was trying to expunge with its postwar rhetoric of
        progress and
        development (Winter-Tamaki, 1985). When Kawara started work on the Today series in 1966, he was considered a
        conceptual
        artist. As Bobrowksa notes of Kawara, “his conceptual artwork deals with the creation of time…outside of the
        natural
        flow of events—they deconstruct history with the rhetoric of the mechanical and the nostalgia for the precision
        of
        order” (Bobrowksa, 2018). However, in their simplicity and the meticulous inventory of each work and the events
        they
        represent, Kawara is exposing his experience of a time-value relationship through text, color, and the act of
        record
        keeping.</p>

    <p>If elements of Kawara’s were modified and use to encode personal textual accounts of events throughout COVID-19,
        this
        qualitatively enriched information could provide new insight into the significance of the time-series events of
        the
        period. The power of personal stories is their emotive ability to captivate. In the time of COVID, many of the
        events
        that would allow one to evaluate the significance of a life lost, like a memorial service have been postponed
        indefinitely. Yet, as journalist Jonathan Freedland notes, “history suggests that even when the mortal danger of
        COVID
        passes, we may not indulge in a collective sorrow/remembering because unlike wars, pandemics do not follow
        linear story:
        clear heroes and villains with intent and motive” (Freedland, 2021). At a time when not only loss of life has
        been so
        great, but also loss of cultural traditions and ways of life, to mark and remember this period with only points
        in a
        time-series chart is to diminish the significance of what it is to be human.</p>
