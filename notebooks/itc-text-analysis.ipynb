    "Inspired by the Date Paintings of Japanese conceptual artist, On Kawara, and the (SÃ¼d-) Koreanischer Kalender / (South) Korean Calendar (1991) created by German conceptual artist, Hanne Darboven, this project used an online survey to collect pertinent dates and stories of thirteen (13) individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic (1 January 2020). The data was cleaned and analyzed via text and sentiment anlysis. As part of a prototype to visualize both quantitative and qualitative data, this analysis will contribute to an ongoing \"data display\" project that will allow users to not only trace the reported COVID cases and death tolls by date, but some personal sentiments and/or reflections of people as well."
